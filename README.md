## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**Surprise3D** is a novel dataset designed to evaluate **language-guided spatial reasoning understanding** in complex 3D scenes. Unlike existing datasets that often mix semantic cues (e.g., object names) with spatial context, **Surprise3D** emphasizes **spatial reasoning** by crafting queries that exclude object names, thus mitigating shortcut biases.

We modified the code obtained from [Intent3D](https://github.com/WeitaiKang/Intent3D) and [Reason3D](https://github.com/KuanchihHuang/Reason3D) to support running on our proposed dataset, we thank their dedicated efforts in their impressives works. You may find modified versions [here](./Models).
